# Futurama Gif Search

> This project generates GIFs when buttons named after Futurama characters are clicked. The user can also generate their own GIFs by     typing in a search. This search will be saved as a button to generate GIF's later as well.

> *Futurama, GIPHY, GIF-GENERATOR*

- API search still has to be optimized.
